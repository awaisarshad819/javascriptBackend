# Reusable Express and Mongoose Projects

This repository contains reusable code snippets and basic project setups using **Express** and **Mongoose**. It serves as a collection of reusable components like data models, utilities, and file structures for future projects.

## Contents

1. **Basic Express File Structure**:
   - A well-organized and scalable file structure for Node.js/Express projects.
   - Includes configuration for routes, middleware, controllers, and environment variables.

2. **Reusable Mongoose Models**:
   - Predefined Mongoose schemas for common models such as User, Product, Order, etc.
   - Includes validation, schema options, and references for relationships.

3. **Utilities and Middleware**:
   - Commonly used utilities for logging, error handling, authentication, and more.
   - Modular middleware for tasks like authentication, request validation, and session management.

4. **Future Projects**:
   - Placeholder for upcoming reusable modules and features, including authentication templates, pagination, and API services.


## Key Features

- **Modular Design**: Each component is modular and reusable, making it easy to integrate into any project.
- **Mongoose Models**: Includes common schemas with built-in validation and relationships.
- **Express Setup**: Pre-configured routes, middleware, and controllers to speed up development.
- **Utilities**: Ready-to-use utilities for token generation, authentication, logging, and more.

## How to Use

- Import models, utilities, and middleware directly into your project as needed.
- The folder structure can be used as a base for any new Express project.

## Future Enhancements

- Advanced middleware for authentication and authorization (e.g., JWT, OAuth).
- Pagination, filtering, and sorting utilities.
- API documentation templates (Swagger/Postman) for rapid API setup.
- Error handling enhancements and logging improvements.
